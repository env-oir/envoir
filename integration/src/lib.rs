//! Cross-component integration tests for the Envoir DMTAP reference stack.
//!
//! This crate has no library surface of its own — it exists to host end-to-end tests under
//! `tests/` that compose the **real** crates (`envoir-node`, `dmtap-mail`, `envoir-gateway`,
//! `dmtap-core`) with no mocks between components. See the individual test files:
//!
//! - `legacy_to_dmtap.rs` — an RFC 5322 message through the gateway inbound, sealed into a MOTE,
//!   delivered into a real node, and read back through a `dmtap-mail` JMAP view; the gateway
//!   attestation is verified end-to-end.
//! - `dmtap_to_dmtap.rs` — two real nodes exchange an encrypted MOTE + ack over the TCP transport.
//! - `adversarial.rs` — a tampered/forged MOTE is rejected before decryption; a deferred cold MOTE
//!   is held but not acked (matching the reconciled no-ack-for-deferred rule, §2.7a / §19.3.1).
//! - `p2p_delivery.rs` — the same DMTAP↔DMTAP delivery shape as `dmtap_to_dmtap.rs`, but over the
//!   REAL `dmtap-p2p` libp2p mesh transport (TCP + Noise + Yamux), with the delivered message
//!   visible through a real `dmtap-mail` JMAP view.
//! - `kt_resolution_and_delegation.rs` — `dmtap-naming` resolves a name to a KT-verified identity,
//!   a forged inclusion proof is rejected fail-closed, and the resolved key mints/verifies a real
//!   `dmtap-core::capability` delegation token.
//! - `deniable_repudiation.rs` — a `dmtap-deniable` 1:1 exchange proving the repudiation property
//!   holds after a real `dmtap-core::deniable::DeniableFrame` wire round trip, not just as an
//!   in-memory struct comparison.
//! - `full_roundtrip.rs` — the whole naming → seal → mesh → mail chain in one composition: a
//!   node's own `resolve_and_pin` (real `dmtap-naming` KT verification) pins a recipient, `send_mail`
//!   HPKE-seals a real MOTE (`dmtap-core`) to the resolved key, delivery rides the real libp2p mesh
//!   (`dmtap-p2p`), and the content is read back through a real `dmtap-mail` JMAP view.
//! - `gateway_provenance.rs` — a gateway-bridged legacy message and a pure-mesh message land in the
//!   same recipient inbox; only the bridged one produces a verifiable `envoir-gateway` attestation
//!   (`captured.len()` distinguishes them), a bit-flipped signature and an attestation lifted onto a
//!   different delivered MOTE both fail closed.
//! - `mls_group_over_real_mesh.rs` — a real RFC 9420 MLS group (`dmtap-mls`) forms and exchanges an
//!   application message over the real libp2p mesh (`dmtap-p2p`), a member is removed, and the
//!   removed member's stale state cannot decrypt a message created after removal (post-compromise
//!   security, §5.2) even when a network observer relays the exact ciphertext straight at them.
//!
//! ## Scenarios considered and deliberately not added here
//! - **Suite-downgrade / capability-rollback rejection through a live node.** `dmtap_core::suite`'s
//!   `SuiteRatchet` and `dmtap_core::capability`'s `CapsVersionTracker`/`CapabilityAnnouncement` are
//!   real, and already unit-tested end-to-end at the library level in the `downgrade-tests` crate
//!   (`suite_high_water_mark_ratchet_should_reject_downgrade_below_pinned_floor`,
//!   `capability_announcement_anti_rollback_should_reject_stale_caps_version`), but neither is wired
//!   into `envoir-node`'s real `Node::receive_mote` accept path (grep confirms no reference to
//!   either type in `node/src`). A genuine *end-to-end* version — an established peer's downgrade
//!   rejected by a live node, honest path accepted — needs that wiring first.
//!   `// TODO(once Node::receive_mote consults SuiteRatchet/CapsVersionTracker): add an integration
//!   test that sends a real peer through a live node at a high-water suite/caps version, then a
//!   downgraded one, and asserts the node itself rejects it.`
//! - **KT equivocation surfaced through `Resolver::resolve`.** `dmtap_naming::kt::detect_equivocation`
//!   is real and already unit-tested directly (two conflicting `SignedTreeHead`s for one log).
//!   `InMemoryResolver`/the `Resolver` trait has no split-view simulation hook — each pinned `KtLog`
//!   returns one deterministic view, so nothing in the resolution pipeline can currently observe two
//!   disagreeing STHs for the same log within one `resolve()` call. `// TODO(once Resolver supports
//!   a per-observer/multi-fetch KtLog view): add an integration test where two fetches of the same
//!   pinned log return mutually inconsistent STHs and resolve() surfaces KtEquivocation /
//!   KtSthInconsistent.`
