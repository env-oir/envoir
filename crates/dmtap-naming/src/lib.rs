//! # dmtap-naming — the DMTAP `name → key` resolver (spec §3)
//!
//! Resolves a human `name@domain` to a **KT-verified, pinned identity key**, exactly as spec §3
//! layers it: **DNS is discovery, the key is proof, KT makes the binding tamper-evident, pinning
//! makes discovery a one-time event.** This crate is the real, testable resolver the node needs in
//! place of its HashMap stub — a reference implementation over `dmtap-core`'s KT objects, not
//! normative (the spec governs, §10.4).
//!
//! ## What it does
//! - [`dns`] — parse the §3.2 `_dmtap` **TXT** and **SVCB** records into fail-closed structs.
//! - [`merkle`] — RFC 6962 inclusion-proof verification + a tree builder (§18.4.10, §18.9.5); the
//!   arithmetic `dmtap-core`'s unsigned [`InclusionProof`](dmtap_core::kt::InclusionProof) needs.
//! - [`kt`] — turn a fetched `Identity` + `SignedTreeHead` + `InclusionProof` into a verified
//!   binding: STH signed by the pinned log key, inclusion folds to the root, committed leaf equals
//!   the leaf recomputed from the identity (§18.4.9), plus the §3.5.2 v1 `> n/2` multi-log quorum,
//!   split-view equivocation detection, and STH freshness. All fail-closed (§3.3): **unreachable KT
//!   blocks, it never TOFU-pins**.
//! - [`resolver`] — the §3.3 flow behind a [`Resolver`](resolver::Resolver) trait, with a fully
//!   in-memory harness ([`InMemoryResolver`](resolver::InMemoryResolver)) so the whole path is
//!   unit-testable offline; a real DNS/mesh/KT network layer is a thin later swap.
//! - [`keypackage`] — the §5.3 async-join KeyPackage bundle fetch seam + in-memory impl,
//!   content-address-checked.
//!
//! ## What is real vs. seam
//! DNS **parsing**, KT **verification** (RFC 6962 folding, STH signatures, leaf binding, quorum,
//! equivocation, freshness), and the `Identity`/chain checks are real cryptographic code exercised
//! by the tests. **Network I/O** (actual DNS queries, mesh fetches, HTTP KT clients) is deliberately
//! left as a trait seam ([`Resolver`](resolver::Resolver), [`KtLog`](kt::KtLog),
//! [`KeyPackageSource`](keypackage::KeyPackageSource)) so a later layer can implement it without
//! touching the verification core.
